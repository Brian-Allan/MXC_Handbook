# Contributing to the MXCHandbook

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the handbook. These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues
Issues are created [here](https://github.com/DutchDevOfficial/MXC_Handbook/issues).

For any issue, there are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:

- By opening the issue for discussion: If you believe that you have found a new bug, you should report it by creating a new issue in the DutchDevOfficial/MXC_Handbook issue tracker.
- By helping to triage the issue: You can do this either by providing assistive details (a reproducible test case that demonstrates a bug) or by providing suggestions to address the issue.
- By helping to resolve the issue: This can be done by demonstrating that the issue is not a bug or is fixed; but more often, by opening a pull request that changes the source in DutchDevOfficial/MXC_Handbook in a concrete and reviewable manner.

## Languages
We accept issues in any language. When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply. Anyone may post the translated reply. In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient. Having the original text as well as the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

Responses to posted issues may or may not be in the original language.

**Please note** that using non-English as an attempt to circumvent our Code of Conduct will be an immediate, and possibly indefinite, ban from the project.
