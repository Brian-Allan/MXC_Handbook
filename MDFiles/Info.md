# What is MXC?
MXC is a Utility Token, also commonly referred to as an Internet of Things (IoT) Token. MXC is building a global data network to allow wireless devices to connect and communicate more efficiently and over longer distances than currently used WiFi and Bluetooth methods. The MXProtocol and the interoperable Para-Chain network are designed to help cities, companies, and individuals profit/benefit from building an LPWAN network and using it to both transmit and manage data. Via MXC contour payments, MXC developers have devised an integrated IoT payment solution to allow automated machine to machine payments and IoT transactions to occur within a matter of seconds.
