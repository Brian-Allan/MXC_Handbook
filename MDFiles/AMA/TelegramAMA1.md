# Telegram AMA with Siwon


Hey everyone 👋 Happy Friday! 
Just here to vibe with you guys for a while and catch up on what's been happening!



- One thing i dont understand : To use the miner m2 pro, do i have to buy too mxc and dhx? to earn mxc do i have to buy first mxc? How the miner m2 pro is profitable?  how much coins do i have to buy after getting the miner m2 pro? how much can I make daily/mouthly ?
*Hey Jorge, you do not need to have MXC to use the M2 Pro to mine. You earn MXC simply by operating M2 Pro, and to mine DHX, you will have to bond DHX token and stake MXC to it*

- I just hope that translating the handbook will provide me a thousand or so...👀🌝🌝
*Translating the entire handbook = 1000 rep. Let's just make that a fact right here and now haha*

- any updates on the new tax reporting and a timeline for the launch?
*It should be ready to launch within the next few weeks. Testing is being done to make sure that it's as accurate as possible, so that it can satisfy any governing authorities*

- Hi Siwon, will the rest of the orders before April 12th get tracking numbers today? Or is there a delay?
*I'm not handling that part, but all I know is that the team is working really hard to fulfil all the orders! I'll ask the team (:
*
- One other question, do you know if there are plans to migrate the old orders to the new MatchX website so we can track order history?
*That would require some backend work to migrate the data over. Definitely something that we can look into, but we will be communicating with everyone so that order tracking can be done one way or the other
*
- Sorry for all this questions But I just bought one Miner because I though it was a miner, but is more like a staking like...and I trying to fingering if this i worth it.
*You don't need to stake to mine (: Mining is independent. 
But it's about what you do with the mined tokens. Think of it like making your profit work for you to create more profit (:*

- @Dutchdev reached the top 10 stop! You should give him so more 😝
*The man is a legend himself*

- Sorry for my english but is not my native language
*You're good! We are quite the international bunch in the community and in the MXC team too!*

- Newbe here... My M2Pro is on it's way. Also installed the DataDash app. Any need to purchase MXC or DHX?
*No need at the moment if you want to do purely mining, If you wish to mine DHX also, then you can buy DHX to bond it, so that you can mine MXC, and lock the MXC to mine DHX (:*

- Hi, I am interested in buying M2 Pro miner and I have read that you can earn around 10 to 14 dollars a day. I have a doubt about this, does the price of the coin (MXC) matter at all? Are you always going to mine the same amount of money? That is, the higher the price of the coin, the less tokens you mine? Thanks in advance.
*The token price is calculated in real time, which means that having an M2 Pro is honestly like having an insurance policy regardless the direction of the market. 
But it's not just 10 to 14 dollars a day. You can use the mined MXC to stake, or lock up to mine DHX. We are introducing more ways to earn. 
We want every MXC supporter to be rewarded in significant ways!*

- hello, any news on the pool staking?
*I'm working out the finer details with all the 3rd parties involved. And honestly the involved technology can sometimes melt my brain, but I've never seen anything like it. 
Should be live by summer (:
and a little early scoop I can share is...the pools will be working with an arbitrage bot that will be perpetually long on MXC 😎 
So that's kind of the "next level" thing*

- what exchange can I find DHX?
*Biki.cc for now. More listings are coming, I hear! 👀*

- do you have any existing or planned smart city partnerships in the US?
*We have done a project in NYC. More will be coming, of course! With the speed of MXProtocol expanding in the US thanks to all our supporters, it's almost a no brainer that many projects and cities will want to partner with MXC (:*

- I'll sneak one question while everyone is watching the video... @ifyouseeone , any sneak peeks on what's coming up after BTC mining? 🙂
*After BTC mining, I think you can expect some cool partnerships! 
I think it's difficult to top the Alibaba x MXC news released recently, but we certainly have some major news coming 👀

Then the next part is building a bridge between MXC and the world of DeFi through liquidity mining program and so on. A lot of parties have partnered with us to make that a possibility, so I think it will be absolutely huge! 

I think we will be one of the first alts that offer completely one-sided liquidity yield farming (so that you can stake your MXC and the other side is matched through the DeFi world)*
