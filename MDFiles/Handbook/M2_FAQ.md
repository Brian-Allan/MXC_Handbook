## What coins does the M2 miner mine?
- **MXC** 
- [DHX](MDFiles/Handbook/DHX.md)
- **BTC** (only testnet for now)
<br>=> mining is **simutalious** 

## How are the M2 earnings?
The M2 mines for **10-14$/day in MXC**. This has been confirmed by various community members

official answer by MXC:
That often depends on the Miner itself. This is ultimately a **‚ÄúProof Of Participation‚Äù model**, so ultimately the first essential element you need to ensure is that you are connected to the MXC system via the Data Dash App. You can do this by simply scanning the QR code on your M2 Pro and connecting to the Data Dash App.
Once the M2 Pro is connected, you are technically mining. However, to improve your minability it is essential that you place your miner in an elevated position, ensure you don‚Äôt incur any internet connectivity interruptions, ensuring up-time. These are the ultimate essentials to mine $MXC and other tokens.
Most miners report that they mine around **$10USDT to $14USDT** with the M2 Pro on a daily basis, yes, on a daily basis, all with very little effort. Of course, there is a general range, and mining of $MXC can increase based on the activity and downlinks you serve, but at present, the approximate rate varies around the above-mentioned amounts. **For more information on average returns please ask our followers in our telegram group or on Twitter.**
The financial return on an M2 Pro can vary greatly, MXC can not give any guarantee on returns, nor on the price of your returns, this is due to the fact that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. **As a company we do our best to ensure you receive a solid return on your investment, we support those who support us.**

## Where can I buy one?
You can buy them straight from the manufacturer:

<br>[Promo code](MDFiles/Handbook/promocodes.md)

## Can I setup/use the M2 Pro miner in my country?
**Yes**, there is worldwide shipping from the EU and US warehouse.<br>
The M2 Pro can work **everywhere**, as long as it has a stable internet connection. 

## How are earnings calculated?
Earnings are derived via the MXProtocol Mining Algorithm, these earnings are primarily based on the following key factors:
- **Miner Elevation**
- **Miner Up-Time**
- **Miner Accessibility**
- **Miner Usage**
- **Data Sent / Received**
- **Miner Accessories**

## Does the M2 Pro interfere with telecommunication devices?
The **M2 Pro doesn't interfere** with other telecommunication devices. As long as you have a good Wi-Fi router (means it can handle all connected devices) you're safe. 

Just run some tests on the connectivity and strength of your Wifi router. üôå

## What is the difference between the M2 Pro and a Helium Gateway?
First things first, The M2 Pro is an outdoor miner with IP 66 standard (Ingress Protection Code) which means it's waterproof and it can be deployed outside and withstand the harshest weather conditions, even a thunderbolt strike (grounding on board). That drastically changes the durability of the miner and all possible use-cases that come out of it. 

Secondly, - the range - **only 8-10 M2 Pros can completely cover with LPWAN the city like Berlin** and handle thousands of sensors/devices at the same time. 

Thirdly, add-ons: which are - LTE module with a prepaid sim-card, Solar Panel and SSD storage - all these updates are coming soon! 

It will give you full independence from any wires or any drops in the internet connection (since SSD serves as a backup for all data that goes through your M2 Pro, meaning you don‚Äôt have to worry about every time when your miner for any reasons goes offline, all data packets will be stored on this SSD, therefore you won‚Äôt lose a single MXC token.

And lastly, apart from hardware supremacy, Helium is simply built using Raspberry Pi solutions which are off the shelf and available anywhere. 

**The M2 Pro uses patented technology that isnt available elsewhere**, these patents cost money and so does the extra effort that we put into our Miner, we built a german engineered miner, and we built it right. üá©üá™‚úä

## How do m2 pro specifications compare to other miners?
The M2 Pro Miner is unlike any other IoT miner, **it is a purpose built, low-power, multi-token Miner, using intellectual property, our own trademarks, and a few pending patents.**

The M2 Pro is a **german engineered** master-crafted Crypto Miner that you simply can‚Äôt buy ‚Äúoff the shelf‚Äù, like other Raspberry Pi-based Miners. How can we prove this?
The M2 Pro Miner is the only IoT Miner offering::
- **2 x 2nd Generation lora gateway chips (SX1302)**
- **16 Frequency Channels**
- **Mines Multi-Tokens $MXC, $DHX & $BTC**

Is an outdoor/external miner with a unique IP66 enclosure and UV resistant coating
Including the Pole Mount with every M2 Pro, you can further your extended reach, **up to 1,256 square kilometres (485 sq/miles)**, this is because the M2 Pro is able to be installed outdoors, in all weather, that‚Äôs unique to the M2 Pro
Dedicated, professional hardware, based on iMX6 industrial processor
The only IoT Miner to offer optional internal 4G communication modem for remote installation
The only IoT Miner with self-diagnostic features including; temperature, voltage, current, power, pressure, and 3D orientation monitoring

The only Miner that supports **passive PoE 12‚Äì24V and USB-PD 20V power supply** for remote installation
Built-in hardware secure elements, xp hardware identification & security
**The all-weather outdoor miner, industrial temperature range from -40 degrees celsius (-40F) to +60 degrees celsius (+140F)**

## Do you need data transfer on the m2 pro to mine mxc?  
M2 Pro runs on **PoP (Proof Of Paricipation)** which includes data transfers as a factor which will be affecting your mining rewards. Though, you still will be mining tokens for just participating in the decentralized LPWAN network. Earning based on data packets will be on top of base income.

## How long will the m2 pro mine for?
The MXC Foundation is committed to creating a vibrant data network. To do this we must ensure that miners stay active, how do $MXC ensure that miners stay active? By continuing the POP process, it is in the interest of $MXC, Miners, and the Data community to keep the M2 Pro miners in operation for as long as possible. Our goal is to have this network fully self-sustainable, but we also realize this will take time, this is a journey we are prepared to walk together, with our miners and community.
In regards to the M2 Pro miner and the material and product itself, we expect our award-winning M2 Pro Miner to continue to function as a data network powerhouse for **up to 10 years**, that‚Äôs **German engineering**, that‚Äôs high-class materials, that‚Äôs MatchX quality!

## Where can i see this global data network?
You can view your, and many other M2 Pro on <a href="https://mxcmapper.com/">MXCMapper</a> this is a website where you can see most of the M2 Pro that are connected to Data Dash and from whom we receive a ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù. Miners who do not demonstrate a heartbeat will not show on this map.

**M2 Pro Miners are highlighted in BLUE**, for other LPWAN / LoRA devices, they are in GREY. We show both of these elements for a key reason, yes, MXC is a company that promotes the $MXC Token and the M2 Pro Miner, but more importantly we are here to promote ‚ÄúLPWAN‚Äù and ‚ÄúLoRa Technologies‚Äù as a basis for our existence. Without this decentralized network, there is no Data Network, so the MXCMapper site allows and promotes new users to this technology to see the length and breadth of this groundbreaking, global data network. We believe in LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) and wherever we can, we will promote this technology.

MXCMapper.com is **manually** updated by our developer team at MXC, there may be a slight lag in the updating of the map, but we will continue to endeavour to keep it relevant for all users.
You will notice that the M2 Pro listed on the MXCMapper.com aren‚Äôt showing an ‚Äúexact‚Äù location, the reason we do this is to protect the identity of our users, this is also because, as a German company we are under strict EU orders to protect the identity and location of all of our users, this is GDPR at work. You may notice some GREY devices in some peculiar places, eg: Antarctica or in the Ocean, this, once again, is a demonstration of the decentralized and global reach of LPWAN and our friends at TTN, we certainly hope to see the M2 Pro in all continents across the globe very soon. This is our vision, and we can achieve this together!
