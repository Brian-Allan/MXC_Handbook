# Public Service Announcement for Android Users

We're still waiting for the app to pass the Google Play Store review. Normally this process takes a matter of minutes, but it's taking a little bit longer this time (or rather a LOT longer :frowning: ). Unfortunately there's not really a way we can speed up the review process. We have an APK available, but as you previously used the App Store version, Android doesn't allow it to be installed. We're working on providing an APK that will be compatible for users who use the Play Store, just in case they keep dragging out the process. 

Really - I'm super sorry about this, I know it's a poor experience, and we're working hard to remedy the problem for you. Keep in mind your token is safe and your miner is mining.

## Update
If you **delete** your current DataDash App on Android (from the Google Store), you should be able to install the APK provided here: https://datadash.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/app-prod-release.apk (it's official, from us)
