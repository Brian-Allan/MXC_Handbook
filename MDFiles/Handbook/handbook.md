# The MXC handbook

Hello there! Welcome to the MXC handbook.
This will guide you thru all steps, questions and answers you need to get started!

## What is MXC?
MXC is an **ERC20 utility token** used for device transactions conducted through the MXC Supernode network. MXC adds value by giving the MXC community a chance to share in Supernode profits through staking.

This is a great video from MXC explaining the protocol:
