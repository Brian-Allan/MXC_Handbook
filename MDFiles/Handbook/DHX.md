# DHX

DHX has given MXC holders the right to premine DHX. This will be performed on the DataDash Crypto App, where anyone can stake, mine and earn tokens. 

## What is DHX?
DHX or DataHighway is a DAO, a decentralised autonomous organisation, the promotion or management does not have a dedicated team of people. Anyone who is qualified and interested in DHX can take part in it. It regulates itself with its own senate and own rules. There is a voting process for example to increase spending or to list on an exchange. Similarly to politics, one person has a vote in DHX. Blockchain and DataHighway gives people the vote and that’s through the DHX token.

## How can I mine DHX?
You need to **download the Data Dash App**. Then you can look for the DHX icon in the DataDash App. Add DHX and get started. **You can then stake your MXC in order to earn DHX.**

*UPDATE : From now you can also bond DHX to mine DHX!*

## Does my M2 Pro mine DHX?
An added incentive for people who have the DataDash App and have already purchased the M2 Pro Miner is that they can use this **M2 Pro as a mining booster** — 1mil MXC and 1 M2 pro is a 2 m-Power boost — next m-power boost level is 2mil MXC and 2 M2 Pro = 4 m-power boost. You can purchase an M2 Pro at MatchX.
