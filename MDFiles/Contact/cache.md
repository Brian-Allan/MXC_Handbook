# Fix cache
To be sure you are looking at the lastest updated version, be sure to clear your browser cache.

## Why do I need to do this?
Most of the time – you never even notice browser caching happening. It runs entirely behind the scenes and usually doesn’t affect your browsing experience. But…sometimes things can go wrong.

For example, you might make a change to your site…but you’re unable to see that change because your browser is still serving up the cached version of that resource. Or, the cache might have become corrupted and is actually interfering with the proper functioning of a web page.

For those reasons, the website might be updated but you are still viewing an order cached version.
