# Telegram AMA with Siwon - 9-May-2021

Hey everyone üëã Happy Friday! 
Just here to vibe with you guys for a while and catch up on what's been happening!


- One thing i dont understand : To use the miner m2 pro, do i have to buy too mxc and dhx? to earn mxc do i have to buy first mxc? How the miner m2 pro is profitable?  how much coins do i have to buy after getting the miner m2 pro? how much can I make daily/mouthly ?
*Hey Jorge, you do not need to have MXC to use the M2 Pro to mine. You earn MXC simply by operating M2 Pro, and to mine DHX, you will have to bond DHX token and stake MXC to it*

- I just hope that translating the handbook will provide me a thousand or so...üëÄüåùüåù
*Translating the entire handbook = 1000 rep. Let's just make that a fact right here and now haha*

- any updates on the new tax reporting and a timeline for the launch?
*It should be ready to launch within the next few weeks. Testing is being done to make sure that it's as accurate as possible, so that it can satisfy any governing authorities*

- Hi Siwon, will the rest of the orders before April 12th get tracking numbers today? Or is there a delay?
*I'm not handling that part, but all I know is that the team is working really hard to fulfil all the orders! I'll ask the team (:
*
- One other question, do you know if there are plans to migrate the old orders to the new MatchX website so we can track order history?
*That would require some backend work to migrate the data over. Definitely something that we can look into, but we will be communicating with everyone so that order tracking can be done one way or the other
*
- Sorry for all this questions But I just bought one Miner because I though it was a miner, but is more like a staking like...and I trying to fingering if this i worth it.
*You don't need to stake to mine (: Mining is independent. 
But it's about what you do with the mined tokens. Think of it like making your profit work for you to create more profit (:*

- @Dutchdev reached the top 10 stop! You should give him so more üòù
*The man is a legend himself*

- Sorry for my english but is not my native language
*You're good! We are quite the international bunch in the community and in the MXC team too!*

- Newbe here... My M2Pro is on it's way. Also installed the DataDash app. Any need to purchase MXC or DHX?
*No need at the moment if you want to do purely mining, If you wish to mine DHX also, then you can buy DHX to bond it, so that you can mine MXC, and lock the MXC to mine DHX (:*

- Hi, I am interested in buying M2 Pro miner and I have read that you can earn around 10 to 14 dollars a day. I have a doubt about this, does the price of the coin (MXC) matter at all? Are you always going to mine the same amount of money? That is, the higher the price of the coin, the less tokens you mine? Thanks in advance.
*The token price is calculated in real time, which means that having an M2 Pro is honestly like having an insurance policy regardless the direction of the market. 
But it's not just 10 to 14 dollars a day. You can use the mined MXC to stake, or lock up to mine DHX. We are introducing more ways to earn. 
We want every MXC supporter to be rewarded in significant ways!*

- hello, any news on the pool staking?
*I'm working out the finer details with all the 3rd parties involved. And honestly the involved technology can sometimes melt my brain, but I've never seen anything like it. 
Should be live by summer (:
and a little early scoop I can share is...the pools will be working with an arbitrage bot that will be perpetually long on MXC üòé 
So that's kind of the "next level" thing*

- what exchange can I find DHX?
*Biki.cc for now. More listings are coming, I hear! üëÄ*

- do you have any existing or planned smart city partnerships in the US?
*We have done a project in NYC. More will be coming, of course! With the speed of MXProtocol expanding in the US thanks to all our supporters, it's almost a no brainer that many projects and cities will want to partner with MXC (:*

- I'll sneak one question while everyone is watching the video... @ifyouseeone , any sneak peeks on what's coming up after BTC mining? üôÇ
*After BTC mining, I think you can expect some cool partnerships! *
*I think it's difficult to top the Alibaba x MXC news released recently, but we certainly have some major news coming üëÄ*

*Then the next part is building a bridge between MXC and the world of DeFi through liquidity mining program and so on. A lot of parties have partnered with us to make that a possibility, so I think it will be absolutely huge!*

*I think we will be one of the first alts that offer completely one-sided liquidity yield farming (so that you can stake your MXC and the other side is matched through the DeFi world)*

## Telegram AMA w Siwon - 3-May-2021

How does it work with sensors, are sensors from other producers compatible with the network or do sensors have to be from MXC in order to work? @Ab CD

M2 Pro utilizes LPWAN technology, namely LoRaWAN as a base for you all well-known MXProtocol. It means that all LoRaWAN compatible sensors/devices can be easily and seamlessly connected to the M2 Pro. Here at MatchX/MXC we believe in power of LoRaWAN technology alongside with MXProtocol. Already starting today, you can connect up to 100K LoRaWAN sensors to an M2 Pro and enjoy low-power IoT. Ôªø ÔªøApart from it, we‚Äôre currently in talks with some manufacturers around the world, that are highly interested to start deploying MXProtocol in its devices on top of LoRaWAN. From moisture and temperature sensors to parking and human detection sensors!

Those MXProtocol pimped-up sensors eventually will lead to additional earnings from your M2 Pro! üòéü§ù

When will the bitcoin testnetwork open to everyone? (Date?) How does the bitcoin mining actually work? Thijs
First of all, thanks for the excellent question, Thijs !

The DKP testnet is designed to last for around a month. That 1 month period is almost coming to an end. Once it ends, we will crunch the numbers and produce a report on it. After tweaking some parts to ensure that the mainnet is as stable as possible, it will be open to everyone. So that‚Äôs coming very soon

The Bitcoin mining aspect is fairly complex. The easiest answer is that since MXC is a parachain, it is free to accept other tokens on the MXProtocol - within the mining network. Thanks to the recent development in DeFi on predominantly ERC, transferring BTC on an ERC network is easier than before. This is how Bitcoin could be transferred on the MXProtocol. The mining aspect involves the testnet participating miners to act as individual nodes and leveraging its PoP heartbeat into mining for Bitcoin, but I won‚Äôt get into all the technical details because it will take far too long!

Will the 4g antenna allow me to place my miner anywhere I want that would normally be hard to stretch an Ethernet cable to. Such as the top of a building or the top of a tree? @Mark mattheiss
As you already might know, ALL your miners will be used as an LPWAN umbrella‚òîÔ∏è for millions of #IoT devices out there (many M2 Pro users already might have seen data packets in their DataDash), it means that the location of your M2 Pro will play a significant role, which eventually brings us to the question:

How can we set up our M2 Pro in the best possible position to ensure a decent coverage?

And the LTE option is an answer for it! üì° Ôªø ÔªøOf course, you may say - what about the source of power?

ÔªøMatchX is already investigating a solar panel addition to your M2 Pro. We were going to do some tests on that add-on, this winter‚Ä¶.but ever-grey Berlin didn‚Äôt provide with such an opportunity. So, I would say for our happy customers who live in sunny places, soon will be to upgrade their M2 Pro with a compact solar battery!

Solar panel + LTE = FULLY INDEPENDENCY AND ZERO EMISSIONS! ‚òÄÔ∏èü§ùüîã

Is anyone from California here or Latin America? üòâ

Could you explain to be able to reference each time that is named in the tg group how the pop system works in the low power mining of BTC. The main misunderstanding is to believe that the power to mine comes exclusively from the sum of the hash power of the m2pro as if it were a powdered mining in the cloud. Thank you @j_wolfeng
Oh wow, that's a very profound question!

You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not the exclusive sum of the hash power. M2 Pro does not operate on a PoW model so there is no hash power to measure. The process involves looking at the PoP mining rate as participating miners would mine data blocks, and leveraging our parachain to convert the rewards within that data block into Bitcoin, and some tweak to essentially position each M2 Pro as an independent yet collaborative node that would bid to mine for Bitcoin dust. So the main aspect is the MXC parachain, not the hash rate.

I tried to simplify it a bit, but I'm not realising it's quite a big chunk of information! :D I'll of course take some opportunity later to talk more in detail about it (:
Siwon

Please could you clarify for the benefit of holders and miners. The ongoing Das Keiser testnet trials has attracted people to this project but are miners actually hashing to mine the BTC rewards or are the BTC rewards a giveaway by MXC for participating in the network? @SilkOP001
I think my previous answer already addresses this aspect. The only part in which direct giveaway by MXC is involved is that a portion of the BTC reward is subsidised by MXC. The technology is there, and it‚Äôs amazing what our parachain can do, and how the industry has evolved to be able to support this. The BTC rewards would be smaller without our subsidy. The reason for this subsidy is to keep it fair. The MXC earnings for miners at the moment are subsidised. So if we took that subsidy away just because the miners are now earning BTC, it wouldn‚Äôt be very fair. Thanks for the excellent question! (:

I own 1 m2pro and several Helium Hotspots. Where does the big price difference come from? #Twitter
Wow, wow things are getting serious here! üôÇ

I will try to keep it short and right to the point üòÅüëç

First things first, The M2 Pro is an outdoor miner with IP 66 standard (Ingress Protection Code) which means it's waterproof and it can be deployed outside and withstand the harshest weather conditions, even a thunderbolt strike (grounding on board). That drastically changes the durability of the miner and all possible use-cases that come out of it.

Secondly, - the range - only 8-10 M2 Pros can completely cover with LPWAN the city like Berlin and handle thousands of sensors/devices at the same time.

Thirdly, add-ons: which are - LTE module with a prepaid sim-card, Solar Panel and SSD storage - all these updates are coming soon!

It will give you full independence from any wires or any drops in the internet connection (since SSD serves as a backup for all data that goes through your M2 Pro, meaning you don‚Äôt have to worry about every time when your miner for any reasons goes offline, all data packets will be stored on this SSD, therefore you won‚Äôt lose a single MXC token.

And lastly, apart from hardware supremacy, Helium is simply built using Raspberry Pi solutions which are off the shelf and available anywhere.

The M2 Pro uses patented technology that isnt available elsewhere, these patents cost money and so does the extra effort that we put into our Miner, we built a german engineered miner, and we built it right. üá©üá™‚úä

When $DOT mining + What should we be expecting in your partnership with Polkadot?
Ah, a Polkadot question! I've been getting quite a few of those, so I'm glad it's here so everyone can see (: I'll try to keep it short! So when $DOT mining...

We are waiting for Polkadot ecosystem to be a bit more stable than it is at the current state. Once that stability has been reached, we will roll out DOT mining. In terms of what everyone can expect... We have hinted at an alliance between Polkadot, Data Highway, and MXC. The partnership will definitely increase the level of MXC‚Äôs involvement within the Polkadot ecosystem. Data Highway will provide the necessary bridge between MXC and Polkadot! And of course, this will make MXC one of the big names in crypto üòâ
Siwon

Its there in the works a platform with all kind of functions (dashboard, monitoring, easy of use, etc) to handle the devices that in the future will connect to the most advance crypto/gateway of lorawan the m2 pro miner?
Great question! And it refers to what is we're actually building here - the future of #IoT! üîß‚ìÇÔ∏è

What you‚Äôre looking for is a Supernode Desktop app the platform that will be eventually a one-stop place for all your needs. Mining, Data Visualization, Miner‚Äôs usage, and statistics.

The Future is bright ‚òÄÔ∏èüí°

How can MXC contribute to crypto mass adoption in Africa when their Miner is quite expensive? #Twitter
I believe Africa is an attractive blue ocean for data economy. I believe as a continent, Africa has the youngest median age with most of the population being very tech-savvy. It‚Äôs also a testing ground for many new technologies in consumer electronics. So I don‚Äôt think the price of the miner is hindering mass adoption of crypto in Africa. Perhaps the miner is higher than an average person‚Äôs disposable income, but it also means that the profit realisation will be much higher in perceived value. We need key partners in Africa who can work with us. So if you know someone or some company, please send them our way!

when a smartcity deal it‚Äôs made between mxc and a government about millions how that money is distribute for? guarantee network coverage, to develop a solution , part is for tokens, develop a plataforma could you explain how that works when we see milllions in a deal? #Twitter
Ah, that's a pretty tricky question! But it really needs to be addressed! So an excellent one, too (:

The government grant is used to develop new technologies and expand the network coverage within that city. The grant also includes the government providing key connections to different corporations. For example, thanks to our partnership with the government in Hangzhou, we were able to establish stable contact and collaboration with Alibaba and Tencent.

A lot of people often think that when we receive millions of dollars from a government as part of a partnership, the money goes into ‚Äúpumping‚Äù the token. If that was the case, it wouldn‚Äôt really be responsible usage of the funds. However, that fund is used to create new streams that will bring returns to the token holders. That stream may not be as fast as most traders would want, but it is a concrete and wide stream. So you will see results of it as things unfold (:

Is there a place where I can see what improvements are brought with each firmware update of the M2Pro? My miners all out of date and I would like to know what I‚Äôm missing out @andresovela
We all love our DataDash and how it woks! But it doesn't mean we gonna stop with future developments!

Our DataDash is constantly evolving and getting more and more exciting features.

Things under current development:

Black mode @mattmarlow üòâ
More information on the status of your miner
Improved interface
Push notifications
Customization of your profile in the DataDash
Internal chat with M2 Pro mates around
Recent updates on MXC/MatchX achievements will be right in your app
More is yet to come! ‚úä

And, please keep in mind that we‚Äôre here for you! All your suggestions and wishes will be taken into consideration to improve the user experience of the DataDash.

Don‚Äôt be shy! Only together we can build the #FutureOfIoT „ÄΩÔ∏è

What kind of sensor we could see in the short future, giving more details about things like ai that you have show in the past? any exciting sensor coming or partnership with big sensor company?
Any #LoRAWAN compatible sensors can work with M2 Pro. Currently, our main focus is on AI Camera (here‚Äôs a link for the Devkit, it‚Äôs called EdgeX - https://www.matchx.io/edgexdevkit/#edgexdevkit).

The camera is made with the same philosophy in mind as the M2 Pro - Plug ‚Äòn Play - it means that everyone will be able to set up this camera for their own purposes, simply by scanning the QR code and it will be connected to your DataDash account and M2 Pros around.

Just an example: you can set up your camera at the front of the door, the camera will be able to detect any human or wild animal presence nearby your property and send you push notifications right on your phone.

Other use-case which are already on its way:

Smart Parking
Vehicle/Human counting
More is coming!
Advantages of this camera:

GDPR Compliant (no personal data is stored on any cloud), everything is processed on the edge!
Energy friendly - consumes just a bit of more energy that your M2 Pro
Solar Panel with a battery onboard for autonomous work, in case something happens with electricity.
Moreover, there is some insider info for our fellow community members.

In the next month, we‚Äôre going to receive the first unit of MatchX AI Camera!!! We will be doing some experiments with it here in Berlin and sharing the results with you!

Stay tuned in for some sneak peeks üì∏üß†

What are the advantages if the team decides to migrate to parachain platform? if difficult to switch if it decide would take several months?
Ever since around 3 years ago when MXC started, we started as a parachain. So I don‚Äôt think migration to the parachain platform is the right word. We were always a parachain, before the parachain hype started. MXC is one of the most established parachain, because we had 3 years to build this. So once Polkadot is more stable, the integration of MXC parachain into Polkadot will be quite seamless. The advantage of this would mainly be on the expansion of the MXC ecosystem, and therefore more widespread usage of MXProtocol, meaning more demand for $MXC üî•üöÄ
