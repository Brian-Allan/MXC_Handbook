# DHX Mining: Explained

## How do I mine DHX?
Download the free ["DataDash" app](https://www.mxc.org/mxcdatadash) for either iPhone or Android, from your phone's app store or play store.

## Do I need the *M2 Pro miner*, to mine DHX?
No, but having the [M2 Pro miner](https://matchx.io/pages/m2-pro-miner) will cut your MXC costs in half.

## Do I need DHX and MXC in order to mine DHX?
Yes, you will need both DHX and MXC tokens in order to mine DHX.

## How much does DHX mining earn, and how does it all work?
You can earn up to 1/70th DHX per day, of however much DHX you already own. For example, if you have 70 DHX, you can earn up to 1 DHX per day.  If you have 700 DHX, you can earn up to 10 DHX per day.

But it also takes MXC in order to mine DHX and to maximize your DHX earnings (i.e. earn the full 1/70th). Specifically, for every one DHX you have, you will need about 4,000 to 11,500*** MXC to maximize your DHX earnings, depending on (a) whether you have an M2 Pro miner and (b) how long you lock your MXC for in the DataDash app.  So if you have 70 DHX, you will need about 280,000 to 800,000 MXC to earn 1 DHX per day.

- ***EXAMPLE 1:***  If you have 70 DHX and you DON'T have an M2 Pro miner, and you want to mine 1 DHX per day, you will need about 800,000 MXC if you've locked the MXC for 3 months (the shortest lock available). 
- ***EXAMPLE 2:***  If you have 70 DHX and you have an M2 Pro miner, and you want to mine 1 DHX per day, you will need about 280,000*** MXC if you've locked the MXC for 24 months. (Note:  Having the miner cuts the amount of MXC needed in half, and locking for longer periods also reduces the amount of MXC needed.)
- ***EXAMPLE 3:***  If you have 7 DHX and you have an M2 Pro miner, and you want to mine about 0.1 DHX per day, you will need about 28,000*** MXC if you've locked the MXC for 24 months.  (Note: If you lock the MXC for 3 months, instead of 24 months, then you would need about 40,000 MXC to mine 0.1 DHX per day if you have a miner.)

   *** *The amount of MXC needed to maximize DHX mining, changes slightly each day; please use the DHX Mining Simulator in the DataDash app to determine the MXC currently needed.*

## Is there a limit on how much DHX one can mine each day?
There are 5,000 DHX tokens that can be mined each day by everyone around the world, so that is really the only limit.

## How much does DHX mining cost?
It's the cost of the DHX and MXC tokens as described above, and the (optional) cost of the miner. It all depends on how much you want to earn and can afford.  You can get the costs of the DHX and MXC tokens from various crypto exchanges. To see the list of some of the exchanges that DHX (DataHighway) and MXC tokens are available on, go to [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) or [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/en) and search on DHX or MXC. 

## Where do I buy the M2 Pro miner and how much does it cost?
You can purchase the M2 Pro miner from [MatchX.io](https://matchx.io/pages/m2-pro-miner) (the manufacturer) and the cost for the miner is 2,499 euros (about $3,000 USD).  There are also several discount codes which give 50 euros off, including:
- **mxchandbook**
- **MATCH50**

## How long does it take to get an M2 Pro miner?
It's currently running about 3-4 weeks delivery in the EU area, and about 4-6 weeks in North America and through most of the rest of the world.

## Does having more than one M2 Pro miner help earn more DHX?
Yes and no. Having one M2 Pro miner allows you to only need HALF of the amount of MXC for maximizing your DHX mining, compared to having NO miner when mining DHX.  But it only does this for the first one million MXC.  A second miner would continue the same benefit past one million MXC (up to two million), that the first miner was providing for the first one million MXC.  A third miner would do the same for two million to three million MXC, etc.

## What is "mPower"?
*mPower* is the name given to how much strength or boost you have behind your DHX mining. It generally relates to how much MXC you have.  But specifically, your mPower is determined by:

(a) how much MXC you have locked, 

(b) how long you have locked the MXC for (e.g. 3 mos, 12 mos, 24 mos), and 

(c) whether you have an M2 Pro miner or not. Having an M2 Pro doubles your mPower.

***Examples:***
- When you **don't have** an M2 Pro miner, and you lock your MXC for 3 months (the shortest lock available), then 1 MXC = 1 mPower or 10,000 MXC = 10,000 mPower, etc.  
- If you **have** an M2 Pro miner, and you still lock your MXC for only 3 months, then 1 MXC = 2 mPower or 10,000 MXC = 20,000 mPower, etc.  
- When you lock your MXC for **longer periods**, such as 12 or 24 months, then 1 MXC can provide greater mPower.  For example, locking for 24 months can give your mPower a 40% boost, which means 1 MXC = 2.8 mPower (if you have a miner), 10,000 MXC = 28,000 mPower, etc.

## How do I maximize or optimize my DHX mining?
In order to maximize or optimize your DHX mining, you will need to have a sufficient amount of mPower for each DHX that you bond.  At the time of writing, you will need just under 11,500 mPower for every 1 DHX you bond, in order to maximize your DHX mining (i.e. earn the full 1/70th DHX of your bonded DHX per day). 

You can use the DHX Mining Simulator in the DataDash app to determine the current amount of mPower (and MXC) needed to maximize your daily DHX earnings, in different scenarios.  If you don't have the full mPower needed per DHX, then you will just mine proportionally less DHX.

## What is "DHX bonding"?
In order to mine DHX, you need to *bond* your DHX in the DHX mining section of the DataDash app (along with locking MXC).  Please refer to the tutorials listed below, or the step-by-step guide below, to learn the specific steps.

## What's the difference between "MXC locking" and "MXC staking"?
**This is important:** For DHX mining, you must use MXC ***locking*** in the DHX mining section of the DataDash app, and not MXC ***staking*** (which is completely separate, and is done in the MXC wallet section of the DataDash app).  Please go through the tutorials, or the step-by-step guide, listed below to learn more details.

## Is there a simple diagram that explains the basic ideas of DHX mining?
Yes, in the DataDash app, under the DHX Mining Tutorial, this diagram does a good of job of showing the basic ideas:

#  DHX - Background & More Information

## What is DHX?
DHX is a cryptocurrency IoT token. DHX is currently available for purchase, sale and mining on several crypto [exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/datahighway#markets) around the world. DHX stands for **DataHighway**, which is a project whose full deployment and use as a parachain is currently under development. DataHighway's members and supporters will ultimately be incentivized to operate a sophisticated IoT parachain based on Polkadot, where they may stake, govern, mine and otherwise participate using the new DHX token and its associated Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and Inter-Chain Data Market. More information can be found in the DataHighway whitepaper at [datahighway.com](https://datahighway.com).

## Who are currently members of the DHX/Datahighway project?
Currently, DataHighway's authorized value-added tokens include:
- [MXC](https://mxc.org)
- [IOTA](https://www.iota.org/)
- [Polkadot (DOT)](https://polkadot.network/)
- [Filecoin (FIL)](https://filecoin.io/)
