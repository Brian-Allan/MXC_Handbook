MXC is also a **global data network**, a network that is quickly spreading across the globe. This global data network is being used to deliver data packets **more easily, across longer distances and faster than ever before**. Using LPWAN technology the MXC Foundation is promoting this global data network via the MXProtocol and the M2 Pro Miner. 

**MXC is a data token, a token that is covering the planet!**

This MXC data token is also commonly referred to as an **Internet of Things (IoT) Token** designed **to help cities, companies, and individuals profit/benefit from building an LPWAN network**.
